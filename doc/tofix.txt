atsynedit.wiki: select all, del, now paste text (also wiki of big size): caret jumps to selection end(it OK) but caret not visible(not blinking)

Attribs+markers. 
now marks adjusted auto on edit (DoCaretsShift) BUT not good: 
1)delete of block with marks: must delet them- not done
2)delete several lines block, mark exists on line of block end (after block): must adjust mark lefter- not done
3)delete at attrib: must shorten attr/ or delete attr- not done
